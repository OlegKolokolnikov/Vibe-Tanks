Place your sound files here:

- shoot.wav - Sound effect when tanks shoot
- explosion.wav - Sound effect when tanks are destroyed
- intro.wav - Background music for the intro/game

The sound files should be in WAV format.

You can find free sound effects at:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://opengameart.org/

The game will work without sound files, but you won't hear any audio.
